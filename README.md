MHacks 8 Project

This is a Web App that I worked on in a Hackathon(MHacks 8), but our back-end did not work, so this is only the front-end part.

The app is aimed at promoting interaction between neighborhoods, and has functions of:
  1. Requsting help from people within the neighborhood:
      * Sender location will be detected and interpreted using Google Maps API
      * Other users within a certain range of the sender will be informed by the system of the request
  2. Accept others' request and help out!
      * Requests will be categorized into different types, for example, borrowing items, taking care of pets, watering plants, etc.
      
This app is not functional but I believe the idea is worth a shot!
